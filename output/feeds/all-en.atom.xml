It was intended to run from Horseshoe Bay to Deep Cove through West Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007 the plans to build the Spirit Trail were announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 the City of North Vancouver &lt;a href="https://www.cnv.org/-/media/City-of-North-Vancouver/Documents/News-Releases/2018/2018-07-20-City-of-North-Vancouver-Celebrates-Completion-of-North-Shore-Spirit-Trail.pdf"&gt;celebrated completing its part of the Spirit Trail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, 16 years after the original plans were created, the draft budget from the District of North Vancouver proposed deferring remaining work on the Spirit Trail for 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is from advocates and concerned citizens who'd like to see this trail completed and provide a safe way for everyone to enjoy the North Shore away from cars.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
